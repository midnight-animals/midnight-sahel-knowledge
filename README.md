> _Sahel_
The Sahel region or Sahelian acacia savanna is a biogeographical region in Africa. It is the transition zone between the more humid Sudanian savannas to its south and the drier Sahara to the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel).

This name was chosen, because our nicknames had animal references.
We wanted to choose some geographical region, that had something to do with nature.
Here, Sahel represented the a region connecting 2 more "extreme" regions: Sahara (=dry) and Savanna (=humid).
Our Collective aims to also connect the more extreme sides which are represented in our world.
