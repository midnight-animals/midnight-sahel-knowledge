1. long todo list
	1. Due to priority reasons, when researching a topic, there is not enough not time to go too deep into the subject, or other interesting topics emerged from the initial research, eg: 
		1. I research topic A, but going deeper takes more time then available
		2. I research topic A, but topic B emerges as also interesting, so I want to check out topic B too
2. Record thoughts
	1. I message and discuss topics with friends on instant messaging platforms a lot. The information generated there is often times interesting, thus I want to record it in a knowledge base, eg:
		1. I give advice on Telegram, and would like this advice to be transferred to Github
