  - Triage
    - It is important, that a task is created at all
    - But equally important, is that the Requester of the task should give their final approval
    - Once that approval is given, the ticket moves to "Todo"
    - Fill out all necessary information
      - initial estimate
      - a background explaining why the task is needed
      - a description providing further information for assignee
      - a goal, that should be achieved
  - Backlog
    - Triaged, but not a priority
    - It was chosen to add another column, instead of just ranking tickets by priority, because the "Selected" column could become really long, thus feels overwhelming
  - Selected
    - The task was triaged, and can be picked up to work on
    - It is expected that the necessary information is available
  - In Progress
    - The task is being worked on
  - Done
    - The task is done
  - On-going
    - A a task, that is on-going
