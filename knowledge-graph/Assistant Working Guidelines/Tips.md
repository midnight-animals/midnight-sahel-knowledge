#tip_initial_reflection
- Take a step back and see how you are doing with a given task. 
  Let's say you estimated 2 hours for the task.
  Then after at least 50% of the estimated time, ie. 1 hour, or preferrably 25% of the estimated time, ie. 30min, you should step back and see if your approach still makes sense.

#focus 
* Deep good quality work

* I avoid “multi-tasking”, because context switching is a focus killer.
* Do you know “flow state”? &rarr; Get to that state

* Because you only have so much time in one day, you have to choose

#benefitial tasks
There is a pitfall to "most benefit" though, because we will tend to over-optimize finding tasks, that bring the most benefit.

## Productivity Optimazation
### Misconception
* That people can be productive or focus on work 24/7 to the same effectiveness
* That people can multi-tasks leading to more results produced &rarr; Focus leads to high quality work 
* That appears busy is productive
* That people don't do random things in their work hours

### How to improve productive & produce deep good quality work
* **Priority task**
  * Do task that bring in the most benefit
  * Potential Pit-trap: To find the task is most benefitial, many would find themselves stuck in a "planning" stage, over-optimazing finding tasks, resulting in more time spent planning than actually doing
   &rarr; **Recognize and be decisive** when it is time to stop planning and do the tasks 
* **Focus in deep high quality work**
  * Get to know your rhythm 
  * Example: "put [focus](#focus) and doing [beneficial tasks](#benefitial-tasks) work into times, where you can concentrate the most, or "feel most productive", which could be 4-6 hours a day. And maybe chunked into different times of the day.
So dont feel "forced" to have productive consecutive 4-6h"
  * Leave the rest of the time doing boring tasks
