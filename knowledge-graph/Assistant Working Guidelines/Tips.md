#tip_initial_reflection
- Take a step back and see how you are doing with a given task. 
  Let's say you estimated 2 hours for the task.
  Then after at least 50% of the estimated time, ie. 1 hour, or preferrably 25% of the estimated time, ie. 30min, you should step back and see if your approach still makes sense.
- Be aware of the Sunk Cost Fallacy (https://www.scribbr.com/fallacies/sunk-cost-fallacy/)
